# School project of school diary

## Week 1
  - Connecting the app to MySQL Database
  - Creating simple user UI

    ### Design assumptions:
    - Creating a login welcome-screen<br>
          - > for teachers<br>
          - > for admin<br><br>
    - Teachers are logging in with the login and passwords provided by the admin<br>
          - > teachers view is the main view of the app (main purpose of the app)<br><br>
    - Admin can add and-or delete teachers - has control over the database<br>
          - > admin account is created ONLY by manual record creation in MySQL<br><br>
